The objective of the scheme is to provide wage for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work at the statutory minimum wage.  The wage is enhanced to Rs.254/- w.e.f. 1st April, 2018.
             The expenditure over and above the approved pattern of Central assistance will be borne by the State.  Hence, though the scheme is in the ratio of 90:10, due to commitment of difference in the amount of wages and administrative expenses the allocation of the State Government is more than 10%.  Provision is to be made for unemployment allowance at the rate of 25% of the daily of Rs.240/- for the first 30 days and ½ (50%) of the wage rate (Rs.240/-) for remaining 70 days is to be borne by the State Government.
